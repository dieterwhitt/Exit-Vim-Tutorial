Shannongram revolution.
## instructions
- Firstly, contact Dieter Whittingham and thank him for not gatekeeping.

- Clone this repository and import the file dieter_whittingham_apr2024.code-profile into your vscode profile settings.

- It comes installed with a few extensions and themes. My favourite themes are Ros√© Pine, XCode Default (in screenshots below), and Poimandres.
